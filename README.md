# ü¶∫ safe-migrations

Make your migrations safe 

## ü™Ñ Features

- PG 13+
- PHP 8.1
- Doctrine Migration

## ü§∑ Why?

Because SQL migrations can execute heavy queries on database which can slow down your application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config

_*For a Symfony > 6.x_

Install in your project 

```shell
$ composer req yousign/safe-migrations
```

Declare the Middleware in your `services.yaml`

```yaml
parameters:
  env(ENABLE_RETRY_LOCK_TIMEOUT): false
  
services:
  Yousign\SafeMigrations\Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\Middleware\RetryLockTimeoutMiddleware:
    $isEnabled: '%env(bool:ENABLE_RETRY_LOCK_TIMEOUT)%'
```

Create a migration template `migration.php.tpl`

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace <namespace>;

use Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Schema;
use Yousign\SafeMigrations\Doctrine\Migration;

class <className> extends Migration
{
    public function up(Schema $schema): void
    {
<up>
    }
}
```

Set this template as default for your migrations in `doctrine_migrations.yaml`

```yaml
doctrine_migrations:
  custom_template: "%kernel.project_dir%/migrations/migration.php.tpl"
```

Enable the retry on lock through the env var in you `.env<.environment>`

```dotenv
ENABLE_RETRY_LOCK_TIMEOUT=true
```

That's it ‚òï

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Migration class

When you generate a new migration, this one extend the `Migration` class of the library which expose the following safe methods.

Each of these methods will generate the right set of SQL requests to make the requested query safe.

<details><summary>Create table</summary>

```php
$this->createTable(table: 'test', columnDefinitions: [
    'id UUID NOT NULL', 
    'PRIMARY KEY(id)',
])
```
</details>

<details><summary>Add foreign key</summary>

```php
$this->addForeignKey(table: 'address', name: 'fk_address_contact', column: 'contact', referenceTable: 'contact', referenceColumn: 'id', options: 'ON DELETE CASCADE NOT DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE')
```
</details>

<details><summary>Rename constraint</summary>

```php
$this->renameConstraint(table: 'address', from: 'id_pkey', to: 'pkey_id')
```
</details>

<details><summary>Comment on column</summary>

```php
$this->commentOnColumn(table: 'address', name: 'name', comment: null)
```
</details>

<details><summary>Add index</summary>

> Note: Adding an index on a table will execute an "analyze" on all columns of the table to update statistics

```php
$this->addIndex(name: 'idx_contact_email', table: 'contact', columns: ['email'], unique: false, usingMethod: 'GIN', where: 'country = "France"')
```
</details>

<details><summary>Drop index</summary>

```php
$this->dropIndex(name: 'idx_contact_email')
```
</details>

<details><summary>Rename index</summary>

```php
$this->renameIndex(from: 'idx_email_signer', to: 'idx_signer_email')
```
</details>

<details><summary>Add column</summary>

```php
$this->addColumn(table: 'contact', name: 'mobile', type: 'text', defaultValue: null, nullable: true)
```
</details>

<details><summary>Drop column</summary>

```php
$this->dropColumn(table: 'contact', name: 'landline')
```
</details>

<details><summary>Set default on column</summary>

```php
$this->setDefaultOnColumn(table: 'contact', name: 'email', value: "'noreply@undefined.org'")
```
</details>

<details><summary>Drop default on column</summary>

```php
$this->dropDefaultOnColumn(table: 'contact', name: 'email')
```
</details>

<details><summary>Set column nullable</summary>

```php
$this->setColumnNullable(table: 'contact', name: 'email')
```
</details>

<details><summary>Set column not nullable</summary>

```php
$this->setColumnNotNullable(table: 'contact', name: 'email')
```
</details>

### Migration execution

If there is a lock while executing a Doctrine migration, the migration will throw a `DriverException` (Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\Exception).

If the SQLSTATE value is **55P03** (_lock_not_available_), the query will be retried up to 3 times with a 10s interval before throwing the thrown exception if it does not succeed.

You will get the following output:

<details><summary>Failed after the 3 retry</summary>

```shell
$ bin/symfony console d:m:m

## üìã FAQ

<details><summary>Does it work with Migration bundle ?</summary>

Yes, of course. There is no incompatibility between this library and the [doctrine/doctrine-migrations-bundle](https://symfony.com/bundles/DoctrineMigrationsBundle/current/index.html).

- [PostgreSQL doc: Multiversion Concurrency Control](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/mvcc.html)
- [PostgreSQL doc: lock behavior](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html): must read, it will help you understand a lot of things about PG locks.
 
  *For example, some DDL queries require an exclusive lock on a table. When the table
  is concurrently accessed and modified by other processes, acquiring the lock may take
  a while. The lock request is waiting in a queue, and it may also block other queries
  on this table once it has been enqueued.*
